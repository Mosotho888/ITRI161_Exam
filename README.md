# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a neural network model on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using Google Colab.

# Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following:

* Google account
* Google Colab account

# Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Open Google Colab in your web browser: Google Colab.
3. Click on "File" > "Open Notebook" and choose the "GitHub" tab.
4. Enter the URL of this repository (or the path to the downloaded code) and click on the search icon.
5. Select the notebook file ExamFinal.ipynb from the search results.

# Running the Code
Once you have opened the notebook in Google Colab, follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the code step-by-step.

Make sure to select the GPU runtime for faster training if available. You can do this by clicking on "Runtime" > "Change Runtime Type" and selecting "GPU" from the "Hardware accelerator" dropdown menu.

The notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries
2. Importing the necessary libraries
3. Load the MNIST dataset and split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Preprocessing the data by resizing the image, normalising pixel values, and splitting the training set into training and validation sets.
5. Defining the neural network model architecture and compiling it.
6. Training the model using the training set and validating it using the validation set.
7. Evaluating the model performance on the test set.
8. Visualizing the model architecture and generating additional visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix).
9. Generating a report with the results and insights.

In short, run the code sequentially
   
Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different hyperparameters to further improve the model's performance.
